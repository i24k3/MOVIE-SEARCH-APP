TASK DESCRIPTION : This task involved creating a Movie Search App using React that fetches movie details from a public API (OMDb API) and allows users to search for movies and save their favorites. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for users to search for movies by title, view movie details such as plot, release year, and rating, and save their favorite movies for quick access.

I used the OMDb API to retrieve movie data and Axios to handle the API requests. The app allows the user to search for movies, and it displays a list of matching results. Each movie in the list shows a poster, title, and a button to view more details. When a user clicks on a movie, they are presented with more detailed information, including a synopsis, cast, and ratings.

Additionally, I implemented a feature to save favorite movies. The app lets users add movies to their favorites list and view them in a separate section of the app. To store the favorites, I used the browser's localStorage, so the list persists even after the page is reloaded.

The UI was designed to be clean and user-friendly, with a focus on simplicity and accessibility. I used Bootstrap for the layout and responsiveness, ensuring the app works well on both mobile and desktop devices. The app features a search bar at the top, a results section below, and a favorites section where users can easily manage their saved movies.

One of the key challenges was handling the asynchronous API requests and ensuring that the UI updates smoothly when the user interacts with it. I used Reactâ€™s `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the state of the app, and incorporated loading and error states to improve the user experience.

The app is feature-rich, allowing users to search for movies, view detailed information, and save their favorites. The user can also remove movies from their favorites list, which makes it more interactive. I made sure to handle edge cases such as no results being returned or an error in fetching data from the API.

Through this project, I gained experience in building a dynamic, interactive React app, integrating it with external APIs, managing state, and working with local storage for persistence. It helped me refine my skills in React, asynchronous programming, and UI design.
